# Solana Key Points

## SOL and Lamports
- **SOL** is the name of Solanaâ€™s native token.
- Each **SOL** is made from 1 billion **Lamports**.
- 1 SOL = 1 billion LAMPORTS

## Accounts
- Accounts store tokens, NFTs, programs, and data.
- We will focus on accounts that store **SOL**.

## Addresses
- Addresses point to accounts on the Solana network.
- Anyone can read the data at a given address.
- Most addresses are also public keys.

## Connections
- Every interaction with the Solana network using **@solana/web3.js** is done through a **Connection** object.
- The **Connection** object establishes a connection with a specific Solana network, called a 'cluster'.
